Procedure:
   
1)You have to list the product. The address will be stored as seller. The seller cannot buy his own product.                   
2)You can buy the product with another address. You have to pay the exact price, otherwise the transaction will get reverted. The money will get stored in the contract.                                
3)Only the buyer can confirm after the product gets delivered. The money will then go from the contract to seller.
